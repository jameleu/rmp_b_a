other bugs I found:
-since there are only 5 transactions per employee in this particular
data set, and one can still click on "view more" when filtering by an employee, 
the next page displayed by view more will just be "all employees" list. The expected
behavior intuitively should be no "view more" unless the filtered employee has more than 5
transactions. When view more is clicked for an employee with 6+ transactions, then only
the employees' transactions from pages 1-2 should be shown, not the "all employees" list.
-span display error: in the instructions, there is a span (with line height formatting, so it should add
vertical space between lines) in the p tag that does not serve any 
purpose besides ruining the horizontal space between the sentences. I deleted it so the sentence appears normal.
To have a line break with space, two p tag sets should be used with the span in the middle
